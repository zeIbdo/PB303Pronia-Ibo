# CKEditor 5 Sample Project

## Setup instructions

### 1. Run the web server

Run local HTTP server (like `nginx`, `caddy` or `serve`) that will serve the files that you created. It's required, as we are using type="module" in our scripts.

### 2. Start the project

Open `index.html`.

### 3. Premium features

If you are using premium features, ensure you fill in the required license keys and URLs. You can sign up for [a free trial](https://orders.ckeditor.com/trial/premium-features) to use all premium features of CKEditor 5.

## Integrate with your project

The editor files are in two folders: `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` (if you use premium features). You need to copy them to your project's assets, and then import with a similar way as the sample `index.html` does.
